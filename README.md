# TechCrunch bot

## Description 

This is the repository of the TechCrunch WhatsApp bot made for my [Spanish YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/f6ZsXNlmeyw) if you want to know more about the development of this project I encourage you to visit that video.

### About the project

This project is a Flask app that exposes one API route with the path `/bot` which allows a POST request. When a POST request is made to that route with a `to_number` field in the JSON body, the function route uses the helper functions to:

- Scrape 10 news from [techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/).
- Summarize those news using the OpenAI's GPT 4-o mini model.
- Send those summaries to the WhatsApp number took from the `to_number`â€¯field using the Twilio client,

## Pre-requirements

- Python, better if the version is higher than 3.8.x
- A Twilio account to get the Twilio account SID and auth roken.
- A OpenAI account to get a secret key.
